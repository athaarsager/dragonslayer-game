# DRAGONSLAYER

## Live Project
In progress. I will update this section of the README with a link once I have it fully deployed.

## Description
A text-and-turn-based rpg where you are tasked with slaying a dragon! The final version of this game will include two different endings you can unlock based upon your choices, though the current version only features one. 

This was developed with a C# api for the backend and a JavaScript/React frontend.  

## Controls
Arrow keys: Change Selection
Enter and Spacebar: Confirm
Backspace and Shift: Go Back One Menu
